This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP: unreachable code after a `return` statement. The `bug.php` file contains a function with code following a `return` statement, which will never execute. The solution is shown in `bugSolution.php`.  This example highlights the importance of careful code structuring and understanding how control flow works within functions.
